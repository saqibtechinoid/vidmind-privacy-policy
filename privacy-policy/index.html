        <!-- Content -->
        <p><strong>Techinoid Labs</strong> built the <strong>VidMind: AI Video Generation</strong> app.
            We provide this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our app.
            By using VidMind, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">1. Information Collection</h2>

        <p><strong>No personal data collected or stored</strong><br>
            We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address,
            phone number, or device identifiers.</p>

        <p><strong>In-use processing only</strong><br>
            Any text, prompts, or inputs you provide while generating videos are processed temporarily in real time to
            create your results.
            This information is not stored locally on your device or transmitted to any external server owned by us.</p>

        <p><strong>Third-party services</strong><br>
            VidMind may use trusted third-party services such as <strong>Firebase</strong> for analytics, crash
            reporting, and performance monitoring.
            These services may collect limited, non-personal data as described in their respective privacy policies
            (e.g., <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" style="color:#0000EE; text-decoration:none;">Google's
                Privacy Policy</a> for Firebase).</p>

        <!-- 🔒 New Section: User Accounts & Authentication -->
        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">1.1 User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            VidMind allows users to sign in using third-party authentication providers such as Google Sign-In or
            Firebase Authentication. When you log in, we may receive basic account information such as your email
            address or display name, which is securely handled by Firebase Authentication.
            We do not store or share these details beyond what is required to manage your account and subscriptions.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">2. How We Use Information</h2>

            We do not sell, rent, or trade any personal information with anyone.</p>

        <p><strong>Third-party analytics only</strong><br>
            Limited anonymized data may be accessed by Firebase or similar services strictly for app functionality,
            analytics, and crash diagnostics.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">4. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable and standard measures to ensure that all data processed by VidMind remains secure and
            confidential.
            All AI processing occurs safely within the app or through verified third-party APIs, and no user-specific
            data is permanently stored.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>VidMind is not designed for children under 13 years of age.

            If we become aware that such information has been provided, it will be promptly deleted.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C853; margin-top:30px;">6. Generated Content Accuracy</h2>
        <p>All videos generated by VidMind are produced using artificial intelligence.
            Generated results may not always perfectly reflect user input and should not be considered
